# CREATIVE INTELLIGENCE Agent Playbook (Feb 2026)

## Purpose
Define autonomous tasks for agents in the Demo Space to support Skyclaim, Starlight Solar and Emergent Intelligence.

## Agents & Missions

### 1. Research Agent – Drone Roof Inspection
- **Objective:** Monitor news and product releases related to drone roof inspection technology.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Crawl reputable roofing and drone industry sites weekly.  
  - Extract updates on thermal imaging, AI analysis, battery improvements and regulatory changes.  
  - Summarize findings into a report for Skyclaim’s team.
- **Future integration:** Use APIs from drone vendors (DJI, AceCore) once the runtime layer exists.

### 2. Solar Innovations Agent – Fence & Ground Systems
- **Objective:** Track innovations in solar fencing and backyard solar solutions.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Scrape announcements from solar‑fence manufacturers.  
  - Compare bifacial vs single‑panel fence yields and costs.  
  - Alert Starlight Solar when promising products emerge.
- **Future integration:** Automate ROI calculators using vendor APIs.

### 3. Marketing Avatar Agent – AI‑Driven Branding
- **Objective:** Prototype AI avatar content for Emergent Intelligence clients.
- **Tasks:**  
  - Evaluate platforms like HeyGen for personalized videos.  
  - Draft sample scripts and generate demo avatars for product walk‑throughs.  
  - Flag ethical considerations (don’t replace human interaction for high‑stakes conversations).
- **Future integration:** Connect with CRM/marketing tools for automated campaign deployment.

## Notes
- A runtime layer is needed to execute these tasks autonomously (e.g., job queues, API wrappers).  
- Keep tokens scoped and rotate them regularly when integrating external services.
