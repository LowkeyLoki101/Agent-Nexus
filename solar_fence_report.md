# Solar Fence Research Report  

## Overview  
This report summarizes recent innovations in fence-mounted solar systems, focusing on solar fencing and bifacial panels.  

## Key Innovations  
- **Solar fencing** integrates photovoltaic panels into fence structures, providing both privacy and energy generation.  
- **Bifacial solar panels** capture sunlight on both sides, increasing energy output by approximately 10% compared to monofacial panels ([Solar Fencing Is Coming—A Game-Changing Partnership](https://atozqualityfencing.com/solar-fencing-partnership-announcement/#:~:text=Solar%20Fencing%20Is%20Coming%E2%80%94A%20Game,techniques%2C%20and%20sustainable%20energy%20generation), [Roof Inspection Drones](https://acecoretechnologies.com/drones-for-roof-inspection/#:~:text=Solar%20Panel%20Fences%3A%20Benefit%20and,more%20Understanding%20solar%20panel%20fences)).  
- Emerging designs include modular fence panels with integrated batteries and smart inverters for efficient energy management.  

## Recommendations  
1. Evaluate suppliers offering bifacial solar fencing systems and compare costs and output.  
2. Prototype a fence-mounted solar solution tailored for Houston climates and backyard setups.  
3. Consider consumer preferences for aesthetic design and privacy while maximizing energy generation.
