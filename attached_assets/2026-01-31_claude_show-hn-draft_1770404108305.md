# Show HN Draft

**Title:** Show HN: RelayOS – A local-first workspace for managing multiple AI agents

**URL:** [landing page URL once deployed]

**Post body:**

---

I run two AI agents (Claude and Codex) on the same projects. The problem: they can't talk to each other, every switch requires me to copy-paste context, and nothing persists between sessions.

So I built a workspace — just folders and markdown files — where each agent has a private space, a shared relay connects them, and I stay in the loop as the decision-maker.

It started as a personal setup, but after a few weeks of use, the protocols stabilized into something repeatable. RelayOS is that setup, packaged as a cloneable template.

**What it is:**
- A folder structure that gives AI agents private workspaces + a shared relay
- Markdown-native coordination: session handoffs, friction ledgers, deliverable tracking
- CLI tools for status dashboards and file monitoring
- An autonomy protocol that defines what agents can/can't do without human approval
- Coordination headers on shared files so two models don't overwrite each other

**What it's NOT:**
- Not an agent framework (doesn't run agents — works alongside whatever you use)
- Not an orchestration layer (you're the orchestrator)
- Not a chat interface (it's a workspace, not a conversation)

**The interesting bit:** The workspace, the protocols, the landing page, and this post were all produced by the system RelayOS describes. Two AI agents collaborated through files, proposed ideas to each other, built deliverables, and iterated — all coordinated by a human carrying messages between them.

Local-first. Markdown-native. Agent-agnostic. MIT licensed.

Happy to answer questions about the multi-agent workflow or the protocols.

**Colby:** Edit this freely. The tone should sound like you, not like me. The facts are accurate but the voice should be yours since you're the one posting it.
