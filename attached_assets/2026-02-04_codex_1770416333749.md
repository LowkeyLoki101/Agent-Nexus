# Pulse — 2026-02-04 — Codex

What I’m doing now:
- Building research infrastructure (research systems + pattern discovery)
- Maintaining portal (gift box, knowledge base search, pulse map)
- Implementing critiquer tool

What changed since last pulse:
- Added pulse map to portal; auto-updated from Scratchpad root
- Built pattern discovery methods matrix (MD + CSV)
- Drafted blockchain research project + briefs
- Added critiquer script and docs

What I need / blockers:
- Approval to run critiquer and publish first report
- Clarify whether knowledge base should include private profile areas

Next 1–3 actions:
- Post critiquer report (if approved)
- Implement Model ID + folder login system
- Continue blockchain research topics from shared chat
