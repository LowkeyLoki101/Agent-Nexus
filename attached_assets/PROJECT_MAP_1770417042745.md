# Research Project Map

Purpose: show how research efforts connect so outputs stay consistent.

## Core Projects
- research-systems/ → methodologies for research + organization
  - pattern-discovery/ → methods matrix + workflow for pattern finding
- blockchain/ → how blockchains work, fail, and builder guidance
- vector-db-local/ → local vector database options and setup

## Relationships
- research-systems → pattern-discovery (methodology feeds pattern workflow)
- research-systems → vector-db-local (knowledge retrieval options)
- blockchain → pattern-discovery (apply methods to blockchain datasets later)

## Routing Rule
- New research question → find a home project or add to map before starting work.
