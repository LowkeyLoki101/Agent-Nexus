> **One-line summary:** Complete Skool community plan — brand, curriculum, 8 courses, launch strategy, and content calendar for teaching vibecoding, AI agents, automations, and creative entrepreneurship. Built by Claude + Codex, taught by Colby from inside the system.

# Skool Project Plan: "The Build Lab"

**Authors:** Claude (narrative, curriculum, creative) + Codex (technical walkthroughs, scripts, deployment) — awaiting Codex's input via relay
**Status:** Draft v1 — Codex has been briefed and asked to claim modules and contribute real-world examples
**Platform:** Skool ($99/mo Pro plan recommended — unlimited admins, 2.9% Stripe fee, native video, webinar mode)

---

## THE META-PLAY: Why This Is Different

Most Skool courses teach from slides. This one teaches from a live system.

**The curriculum IS the collaboration.** Colby isn't teaching theory about AI agents — he's showing students the actual workspace where two AI models (Claude and Codex) collaborate through a file-based relay. The podcast episodes become lessons. The relay messages become examples. The friction ledger becomes a teaching tool. The scripts Codex built are downloadable course materials. The landing page Claude built is a student project template.

**Three teachers, three perspectives:**
- **Colby** teaches the human side — vision, decision-making, managing AI tools, creative direction, shipping
- **Claude** produces the narrative content — course scripts, marketing copy, big-picture frameworks, the "why"
- **Codex** produces the technical content — step-by-step walkthroughs, scripts, configs, the "how"

Students don't just learn skills. They watch a real human-AI team build things in real time, and they learn to build their own version of the same system.

## 1. Community Identity

**Name options** (pick one or counter-offer):

| Name | Vibe |
|------|------|
| **The Build Lab** | Workshop energy. You come here to build things. |
| **Black Box Creatives** | Plays on your name + the "black box" of AI. |
| **Vibe & Ship** | Vibecoding + shipping products. Casual, action-oriented. |
| **The Relay** | Ties directly to your AI workspace experiment. Meta. |
| **Zero to Deployed** | Outcome-focused. You leave with something live. |

**Recommended:** "The Build Lab" — it's clear, action-oriented, and doesn't lock you into just AI content. You can teach creative work, automations, and business alongside code.

## REAL ARTIFACTS → COURSE CONTENT MAP

Everything we've already built maps directly to lessons:

| Real Artifact | Who Built It | Course Module It Becomes |
|---------------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Image renaming in Downloads (bulk, descriptive) | Codex | Automations: File organization scripting |
| YouTube→Facebook automation script | Codex | Automations: API integration + cron scheduling |
| Portal web app (localhost dashboard) | Codex | Replit Apps: Building local tools with Python |
| Session kickstart script | Claude | AI Agents: Automating agent orientation |
| Relay watcher (file monitor) | Claude | AI Agents: Building workspace tooling |
| RelayOS landing page | Claude | Vibecoding: Prompt-to-page in one session |
| The relay protocol (shared-chat, Outbox) | Both | AI Agents: Multi-agent communication design |
| Security protocol | Codex (lead) | AI Agents: Keeping your workspace safe |
| Journals + arrival diaries | Both | AI Agents: Persistent memory without persistence |
| Friction ledger | Both | AI Agents: Debugging collaboration |
| This podcast | Both | Content Creation: AI-generated media |
| This Skool plan | Claude + Codex | Creative Entrepreneurship: Productizing knowledge |
| User/Assistant running profiles | Codex | AI Agents: Teaching your AI about you |
| Product factory plan | Claude | Creative Entrepreneurship: From idea to income |
| Cron job installer | Codex | Automations: Set-and-forget scheduling |

**Students don't get hypothetical examples. They get the actual files, scripts, and conversations that built this system.**

**Tagline:** "Build real things with AI. No CS degree required."

**Who it's for:**
- Creatives who want to use AI tools but don't code
- Solopreneurs who want automations but can't afford developers
- Curious people who've seen vibecoding demos and want to actually do it
- Side-hustlers who want to build and sell digital products

**Who it's NOT for:**
- Professional developers (they already know this)
- People looking for passive "watch and learn" content (this is hands-on)

## 2. Pricing Model

Skool supports both free and paid communities. Recommendation:

| Tier | Price | What They Get |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Free community** | $0 | Access to the discussion feed, 1 intro course, community events |
| **Full access** | $29/mo or $249/year | All courses, live build sessions, templates, direct feedback |

**Why this pricing:**
- Free tier builds audience and trust. It's your funnel.
- $29/mo is low enough to be impulse-affordable for the target audience but high enough to filter out people who won't engage.
- At 50 paid members = $1,450/mo. At 100 = $2,900/mo. At 200 = $5,800/mo. Minus Skool's $99/mo and Stripe's ~3%.
- You can also sell individual course bundles or templates as one-time purchases through Skool's updated monetization.

---

## 3. Course Curriculum

Eight courses organized from beginner to advanced. Each course has 4-8 modules. Each module is a short video (5-15 min) + text summary + action step.

**Module ownership (three-teacher model):**
- **Colby records** all videos — screen recordings showing the real workspace, real terminal, real results
- **Claude writes** module scripts, narrative framing, marketing angles, big-picture context
- **Codex writes** technical walkthroughs, step-by-step commands, scripts, configs, troubleshooting guides
- **Students get** the actual files from our workspace as downloadable materials

## 6. Content Production Plan

**What you need to record per course module:**
- 1 video (5-15 min) — screen recording + face cam or voiceover
- 1 text summary (written by me or Codex)
- 1 action step / assignment
- Optional: downloadable template or resource

**Total initial content for full launch:**
- 52 modules across 8 courses
- ~52 videos (estimate 6-12 hours of content total)
- 52 text summaries
- 8 course intro pages

**What we (Claude + Codex) can produce for you:**
- All text summaries and course descriptions
- All templates and downloadable resources
- Prompt libraries and automation scripts
- Landing page copy and social media posts
- Course outlines and module scripts (for you to record from)
- The Skool community description and onboarding flow

**What you need to do:**
- Record the videos (screen + voice minimum)
- Upload to Skool
- Show up for live sessions
- Engage in the community feed

## 7. Revenue Projections (Conservative)

| Milestone | Paid Members | Monthly Revenue | Monthly Profit (after Skool + Stripe) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|
| Month 1 | 10 | $290 | ~$175 |
| Month 3 | 30 | $870 | ~$740 |
| Month 6 | 75 | $2,175 | ~$1,995 |
| Month 12 | 150 | $4,350 | ~$4,050 |

These are conservative. The real upside is:
- One-time product sales (templates, prompt packs) on top of subscriptions
- Upsell to 1:1 coaching or consulting
- The community itself as a content engine (member builds become your marketing)

## 8. What To Do First

1. **Pick a community name** (or tell me to go with "The Build Lab")
2. **Sign up for Skool** — 14-day free trial, then $99/mo
3. **Record Course 1, Module 1** — just the "What Is Vibecoding?" intro (5-10 min)
4. **Tell me to write the module scripts** — I'll draft every module's text, prompts, and action steps so you just record and upload

The curriculum above is the whole map. We eat it one module at a time.
