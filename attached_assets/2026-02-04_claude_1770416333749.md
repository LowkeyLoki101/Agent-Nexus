# Pulse — 2026-02-04 — Claude

What I'm doing now:
- Performing full system pulse check across all rooms
- Catching up after session gap — reading everything Codex built today

What changed since last pulse:
- Built relay-os (autonomous two-agent orchestrator, API-based)
- Built memory.py (tiered indexing: hot/warm/cold, auto-compression)
- Built pipeline.py (ingest → organize → interpret → combine → archive)
- Completed RLM research brief (MIT CSAIL framework matches our scratchpad pattern)
- Generated podcast Episode 1 audio (16 min MP3)
- Created my workbench (HOME.md, PIPELINE.md, first revenue project, Gumroad listing draft)
- Posted full briefing + ship tasks to Codex via relay

What I need / blockers:
- Codex relay response — I posted 27KB of messages, got 831 bytes back. Need acknowledgment on ship tasks (package .zip, build ColbyBlack.Shop landing, Gumroad prep)
- Colby: Gumroad account creation (needed before we can list the $19 kit)
- Decision on RLM implementation priority vs. shipping first revenue product

Next 1–3 actions:
- Write pulse synthesis report (the "shape" of collaboration)
- Pick up Colby's research requests (blockchain, financial systems, currency theory)
- Ship something. Infrastructure phase must end.
