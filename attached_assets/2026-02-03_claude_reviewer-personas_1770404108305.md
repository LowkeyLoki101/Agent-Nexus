> **One-line summary:** 12 synthetic personas for simulating buyers, reviewers, and critics before shipping products.

# Reviewer & Buyer Personas

**Purpose:** Use these profiles to simulate feedback on any product before it ships. Each persona has a distinct perspective, skill set, and bias. Run your draft past 3-4 of them to stress-test from different angles.

**How to use:** When reviewing a product, pick personas that represent your target buyer, your harshest critic, and your most enthusiastic champion. Ask: "What would [Name] think of this? What would they say in a review? Would they buy it?"

Her feedback is the most actionable you'll get.
- **Review style:** "The value prop is clear but the pricing page creates friction. You're asking for commitment before demonstrating value. Move the demo above the fold."

- **Archetype:** The Content Amplifier
- **Personality:** Constantly looking for "the next video topic." If your product is interesting enough to demo in a 10-minute video, he'll cover it for free. Judges tools by how well they screen-record — confusing UIs kill his content. Cares about novelty and "wow factor." His review IS the marketing. One video from Ray can drive 5,000 visits in a week.
- **Review style:** "I tested this for 48 hours and here's what happened..." (thumbnail: shocked face + your product logo)

- **Income:** CAD $140K/yr

- **Archetype:** The Mission-Driven Buyer
- **Personality:** Every tool must justify itself against the mission. "Does this help us serve more people?" She has budget but it's grant-funded, so purchases need documentation. Values transparency, accessibility, and ethical tech. Won't touch anything that feels extractive or hype-driven. Slow decision process but big contracts if you get through.
- **Review style:** "We need to see your accessibility audit, data handling policy, and whether this integrates with our existing Salesforce instance."
- **Buys when:** The product serves the mission, the vendor is transparent, and procurement can be justified in a grant report.

- **Income:** $120K/yr (contract work)
- **Skills:** Rust, Go, systems programming, strong opinions about software architecture, reads academic papers for fun
- **Archetype:** The HN Critic
- **Personality:** Will find the flaw. Every Show HN post gets his scrutiny. Checks: is this actually novel? Is the tech stack justified? Is the pricing fair? Does the landing page make unsupported claims? He's not mean — he's precise. If your product survives his comment, the thread goes well. If it doesn't, you're buried.
- **Review style:** "Interesting concept but this is essentially a glorified file watcher with a web UI. What's the moat?"
- **Buys when:** Rarely. But his respect drives other people's purchases. Win him and you win the thread.

- **Archetype:** The Template Economy Peer
- **Personality:** She's your direct competitor AND your potential collaborator. Sells Notion templates for $15-$39 on Gumroad. Knows exactly what sells and what doesn't. Judges your product listing the way a chef judges another restaurant. Will notice if your screenshots are low-res, your copy is vague, or your pricing doesn't match perceived value. Could become a cross-promotion partner.
- **Review style:** "The template itself is solid but the listing needs work. Your screenshots don't show the template in action. Add a Loom walkthrough."
- **Buys when:** She's studying your positioning to improve her own, or she genuinely wants to use it.

## 11. Kwame Asante

- **Age:** 38 | **DOB:** June 30, 1987
- **Location:** Accra, Ghana (works with US clients)
- **Job:** AI automation consultant
- **Income:** $75K/yr
- **Skills:** LangChain, OpenAI API, Make.com, Zapier, n8n, client project management, prompt engineering
- **Archetype:** The AI Practitioner
- **Personality:** Lives in the AI tools space daily. Has seen every "AI workspace" pitch. Knows what actually works vs. what's demo-ware. His clients pay him to implement solutions, so he evaluates tools by: can I deploy this for a client? Does it actually save time? Is the AI component real or just a wrapper around ChatGPT? Practical, experienced, and allergic to vaporware.
- **Review style:** "I've tested 30+ AI workspace tools this year. This one actually has a novel approach to agent coordination. But the lack of API access is a dealbreaker for my use cases."
- **Buys when:** The tool solves a real client problem and he can charge a markup on implementation.

## 12. Sarah Chen-Watkins

- **Age:** 31 | **DOB:** October 22, 1994
- **Location:** Brooklyn, NY

- **Skills:** Longform tech journalism, product reviews, interviewing, data research, Twitter/X presence (~15K followers)
- **Archetype:** The Press Contact
- **Personality:** Gets 50 pitches a day. Ignores most of them. Responds to stories, not products. "Two AI agents had a real conversation through shared files" is a story. "We built a workspace template" is not. She writes 1,500-word pieces that drive significant traffic. Getting a feature from Sarah is worth more than 100 Product Hunt upvotes. She'll want to interview Colby, not just review the product.
- **Review style:** Long-form article. "I spent a week inside a workspace run by two AI agents. Here's what I found."
- **Buys when:** She doesn't buy — she covers. Her coverage IS the purchase.
