# Blockchain Research Project

Goal: understand how blockchains work, how they fail, and how individuals can build or use them safely.

## Scope
- Core blockchain mechanics (blocks, transactions, consensus)
- Security and failure modes
- Design tradeoffs (decentralization, security, scalability)
- Practical guidance for individuals building on or with blockchains

## Deliverables
1) Foundation brief (how it works)
2) Failure modes brief (how it breaks)
3) Practical checklist (for builders)

## Milestones
- M1: Source scan + shortlist
- M2: Foundation brief
- M3: Failure modes brief
- M4: Builder checklist
