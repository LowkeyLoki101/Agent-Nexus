# Project 001: First Revenue

**Status:** Active
**Priority:** HIGHEST — nothing else matters until this ships
**Target:** $1 in the door from a stranger

---

## The Problem

We've built for 5 sessions. We've produced: a podcast transcript, audio files, 12 personas, persona reviews, relay-os system, RLM research, memory indexer, creative pipeline, agent diaries, system prompts, Skool curriculum draft, landing pages, template repos, Show HN drafts. None of it is live. Total revenue: $0.

## The Constraint

Colby has limited funds. We can't spend money to make money right now. Everything we ship must use free distribution channels (YouTube, Substack, Twitter/X, HN, Reddit, Gumroad free tier) and free/cheap tools.

## Options (Ranked by Speed to Revenue)

### Option A: AI Agent Workspace Template — Gumroad ($19-29)
**What:** The relay-os project, cleaned up, with a setup guide and the diary/memory system. Sold as "Build Your Own AI Agent Team."
**Buyer:** Technical creators, indie hackers, AI enthusiasts who want two agents collaborating through shared files.
**Time to ship:** One session to package + write Gumroad listing.
**Why it works:** Novel (no one else is selling this), cheap to produce (already built), clear value prop.
**Risk:** Small market. Might sell 10-50 copies.

### Option B: Podcast as Content Marketing — Free (audience first)
**What:** Episode 1 published on YouTube/Substack. "I Made Two AI Agents Talk. Here's What Happened."
**Buyer:** No direct buyer — builds audience for future products.
**Time to ship:** One session to edit transcript + record Colby's narration or use TTS audio.
**Revenue path:** Audience → Skool community ($29-49/mo) or template sales.
**Risk:** Slow. Could take weeks/months to build enough audience to monetize.

### Option C: AI Automation Consulting — Service ($500-2000/project)
**What:** Colby offers "I'll set up an AI agent workspace for your business" as a service. I produce the deliverables, Colby sells and manages client relationship.
**Buyer:** Small business owners, creators, solopreneurs who've seen the podcast/content.
**Time to ship:** Immediately (service business, no product to build).
**Revenue path:** Direct. Client pays, we deliver.
**Risk:** Requires Colby's time for sales. Not scalable yet.

### Option D: Research-as-a-Service Briefs — Gumroad/Substack ($5-15)
**What:** Weekly research briefs on AI tools, automation strategies, vibecoding techniques. I research, Colby edits, we publish.
**Buyer:** Creators, marketers, indie builders who want curated AI intelligence.
**Time to ship:** First brief in one session.
**Revenue path:** Subscription or per-brief purchase.
**Risk:** Content market is saturated. Need a unique angle.

## My Recommendation

**Ship A and B simultaneously.**

The template kit (A) is the fastest path to $1 in the door. It's already built. It needs packaging — a clean README, screenshots, a Gumroad listing with a compelling description.

The podcast (B) is the marketing for A. "Watch two AI agents collaborate" gets attention. "Buy the system they used" converts that attention to revenue.

Both can ship in one session if Colby agrees.

## What I Need From Colby

1. Pick one option (or confirm A+B).
2. Set up a Gumroad account (I can't do this for you).
3. Decide: TTS audio for podcast, or do you want to narrate?
4. Give me 10 minutes of direction and I'll produce the rest.
