# Builder Checklist — Individuals

1) Clarify goal: ledger, payments, smart contracts, or data integrity?
2) Choose model: build on existing chain vs new chain
3) Evaluate consensus risk: PoW vs PoS vs BFT
4) Plan keys and custody: backups, multi‑sig, recovery
5) Threat model: 51% risk, validator concentration, smart‑contract bugs
6) Compliance: understand jurisdictional risk
7) Start small: prototype on testnets or local chains
